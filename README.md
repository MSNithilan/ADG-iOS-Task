Sir

As my college reopens on the second week of July, I need to make things ready to go to hostel. 

So far I have been assigned & completed these tasks:
1. To create a back end client-side and server-side validation for "login" and "sign up" forms for the front end gaming website login page that is connected to phpMyAdmin as the database which lets the user either log in, sign up or log out of the account from home page- completed 
2. ‚Å†To design the front end of the gaming website assigned to me by the design team from figma to a html, css and javascript file - completed
3. To create and design a mini crossword puzzle using html, css and javascript for the gaming website that runs in desktop which matches the theme of the already existing gaming website - completed 

Thank you for the opportunity. It has been a great experience working from an office environment.

Request you to issue the internship certificate.

Thanks
M.S.Nithilan
